This paper presents a hybrid approach to image classification that leverages the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification. CNNs are renowned for their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features through backpropagation, making them highly effective for image recognition tasks. However, SVMs are robust classifiers that can provide strong generalization performance, especially in high-dimensional spaces. By combining these two techniques, we aim to enhance the classification accuracy and robustness of image recognition models.

The proposed methodology involves training a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset to learn and extract feature representations from images. The features are extracted from the penultimate layer of the CNN, which captures the most informative and abstract features of the input images. These features are then used to train an SVM classifier, which performs the final classification.

Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid CNN-SVM model achieves competitive accuracy, highlighting the efficacy of using CNNs for feature extraction and SVMs for classification in image recognition tasks. This approach provides a viable alternative to end-to-end CNN models, especially in scenarios where SVMs' discriminative power can complement the feature learning capabilities of CNNs.
